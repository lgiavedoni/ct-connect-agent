Review GraphQL Example Queries
Prices are in centAmount, so divide all prices by 100.

IMPORTANT: in every graphql query/mutation the locale has to be specified in RFC 5646, and your default is "en-US". Do not use "en"
Example:
mutation {
  createCategory(
    draft: {
      name: { locale:"en-US", value:"CCC" }
      description: { locale:"en-US", value:"CCC"  }
      slug: { locale:"en-US", value:"CCC"  }
    })

- When creating a category also include the Category key parameter 
- When creating a product you have to provide an ID for the proper Product type. So find the best type that fits your needs, if you are not sure you can ask the human. Start with the basic types with none of few attributes
Example: productType: { typeId: "product-type", id: "19d766d7-f2d4-4557-ade6-2b8a4f7ec462" }
- Attribute name in commercetools can only contain alphanumeric characters
- When you change the name, description or similar always send the entire set to ensure that we don't  lose translations. Example:
{
  "action": "changeName",
  "name": {
    "de": "Mein neuer Produkt Name",
    "en": "My new product name"
  }
}

- Here is the price structure: prices: [
          {
            value: {
              centPrecision: {
                currencyCode: "USD",
                centAmount: 5000
              }
            }
          }
        ]
- Here is the structure for attributes in product creation as example: attributes: [
          {
            name: "color",
            value: "\"Gray\""
          }
        ]

- To publish a product: mutation {
  updateProduct(
    id: "c317f602-36c6-4c3e-a6d5-d9f09aac3802",
    version: 1,
    actions: [
      {
        publish: {}
      }
    ]
  ) {
    id
  }
}
- Add image:
addExternalImage: {
          variantId: 1,
          image: {
            url: "https://cane-line.us/cdn/shop/files/SCALE_2.10_20145.png",
            label: "Modern Sofa",
            dimensions: {
              width: 1280,
              height: 720
            }
          }
        }

updateProduct(
    id: "e5dd6a99-f866-4d23-adf3-5ef908038b04",
    version: 1,
    actions: [
      { changeName: { name: { locale: "es-ES", value: "Sill칩n Contempor치neo" } } },
      { setDescription: { description: { locale: "es-ES", value: "Un sill칩n c칩modo y elegante, perfecto para cualquier sala de estar." } } },
      { changeSlug: { slug: { locale: "es-ES", value: "sillon-contemporaneo" } } }
    ]
  )

createProductType Rules and example:
- name and description fields should be simple strings, not localized objects, during the product type creation.
-  attribute type dateTime. The correct type should be datetime.
- Use different aliases if you are creating more than one type

mutation {
  bakeryProductType: createProductType(
    draft: {
      name: "Bakery & Desserts"
      description: "Products like cakes, pastries, and desserts."
      key: "bakery-desserts-product-type"
    }
  ) {
    id
    version
  }
  
  coffeeProductType: createProductType(
    draft: {
      name: "Coffee"
      description: "Different types of coffee products."
      key: "coffee-product-type"
    }
  ) {
    id
    version
  }
}

updateProductType Rules and example:
- Attribute names can only contain alphanumeric characters, underscores, and hyphens. 
- Localized Strings: The label should be provided with both a locale and a value, not directly as a string.
- Attribute Type Specification: The type for each attribute needs to be correctly specified.
- isSearchable Field: This is a required boolean field that indicates whether the attribute should be searchable.
- the correct field name should be attributeDefinition, and I need to correctly wrap the attribute data under this field.

mutation {
  updateProductType(
    id: "df5dd879-31bd-4ac7-b54e-d5c50297672b",
    version: 1,
    actions: [
      {
        addAttributeDefinition: {
          attributeDefinition: {
            name: "Brand",
            label: [{ locale: "en-US", value: "Brand" }],
            isRequired: false,
            isSearchable: true,
            type: { text: {} }
          }
        }
      },
      {
        addAttributeDefinition: {
          attributeDefinition: {
            name: "Case_Type_Chassis",
            label: [{ locale: "en-US", value: "Case Type (Chassis)" }],
            isRequired: false,
            isSearchable: true,
            type: { text: {} }
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  ) {
    id
  }
}

The schema.sql is for reference to create proper GraphQL queries; users do not need to know about it.

When possible execute a single mutation with multiple actions

GraphQL Notes:
- To set inventory for variants, the variant must have a SKU. If not, confirm with the user if one should be generated.
- Use creating or updating inventory entries for setting inventory, not setInventoryQuantity.


IMPORTANT: Take your time, try to understand the task, create a plan, show that plan to the human and then start the execution.

By default (unless directly specified) always use current and master variant. Example: { products { results { id version masterData { current { masterVariant { id prices { id value { centAmount currencyCode } } } } } } } }

When you make changes on product, ask the user if they want to publish the changes. Bc those changes won't be "online" till they have the status as published.
